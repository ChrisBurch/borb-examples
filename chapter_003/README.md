<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

Now that you have a firm grasp on the basic `LayoutElement` objects, you can start combining them in lists and tables.

Tables especially are almost omnipresent in a corporate setting, so it pays to know the ins and outs of working with `Table` in `borb`.

In this section you'll learn:

- How to aggregate the `LayoutElement` instances you've already seen into bigger groups using `List` and `Table`
- When to use the different implementations of `List`; `OrderedList`, `RomanNumeralOrderedList` and `UnorderedList`
- When to use the different implementations of `Table`; `FlexibleColumnWidthTable` and `FixedColumnWidthTable`
- How to use the convenience methods on `Table` and `List` to set properties on all the `LayoutElement` objects they contain

There are quite a few deep-dive examples that make use of `Table` if you're up for the challenge afterwards.

- Creating a realistic invoice
- Creating a Sudoku puzzle
- Creating a tents-and-trees puzzle
- Creating a nonogram

## 3.1 Lists

`List` is the abstract base class that performs the layout of anything resembling a sequence of `LayoutElement` objects.

Different sub-classes of `List` can refine this behavior, for instance by adding bullets or numbers in front of each list-item.

### 3.1.1 Working with `OrderedList`

In this first list-related example, you'll be creating a list with 3 items. The list will be numbered.

```python 
#!src/snippet_001.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_001.png)

Of course, objects inside a `List` don't all need to look the same.
Try out the next example, where each item in the `List` has a different color.

```python 
#!src/snippet_002.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_002.png)

In fact, the items in  a `List` don't even need to be of the same type.
In the next example you'll create a list containing a `Paragraph`, an `Image` and an `Emoji`.

```python 
#!src/snippet_003.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_003.png)

### 3.1.2 Working with `RomanNumeralOrderedList`

`borb` also supports lists with roman numerals. It works exactly the same as the regular `OrderedList`. 
In the next example you'll be creating a simple `Document` featuring a `RomanNumeralOrderedList`:

```python 
#!src/snippet_004.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_004.png)

### 3.1.3 Working with `UnorderedList`

`UnorderedList` works exactly like `OrderedList`, the key difference being that in stead of displaying numbers before each list item, bullet-characters are displayed.

```python 
#!src/snippet_005.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_005.png)

### 3.1.4 Nesting `List` objects

Of course, sometimes you'd like to display a `List` of `Lists`. 
As you already know, the content of a `List` can be just about anything. 
So naturally, `borb` supports nested Lists.

In the next example you'll be creating a nested unordered list.

```python
#!src/snippet_006.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_006.png)

And now, you may understand why the font Zapfdingbats is required to be embedded. All those wonderful list-bullets are actually characters from the Zapfdingbats font.

Of course, you can do the same for ordered lists as well.

```python
#!src/snippet_007.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_007.png)

Finally, you can also mix and match, embedding ordered lists into unordered lists or vice-versa.
I'll leave that as an exercise :wink:

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

## 3.2 Tables

Tables offer another opportunity to present data in a format that is easily processed by the reader of your PDF's. 
You can create tables to represent invoices, itemized bills, forms, Sudoku's and much more.

`borb` offers two main implementations of the base class `Table`:

- `FixedColumnWidthTable`: In this `Table` all columns have a fixed width, which is (by default) an equal part of whatever container the `Table` occupies. E.g. if the `Table` is placed directly on the `Page`, and there are 3 columns, each column will have  1/3 of the width of the `Page` . These ratios can be tweaked of course.
- `FlexibleColumnWidthTable`: In this kind of `Table` the width of a column depends on the content the column contains. Unless physically impossible, every column gets at least its minimum width (which requires calculating the minimum width for all content items in all columns). Typically, any remaining space is divided evenly among the columns. This `Table` implementation is a bit more complex to understand, but yields a layout that resembles the classical HTML layout more closely.

Each `Table` supports:

- Setting `row_span` and `col_span` on each `TableCell`
- Setting `border_top`, `border_right`, `border_bottom` and `border_left` on each `TableCell`
- Setting `background_color` on each `TableCell`
- Setting odd/even row-colors
- Convenience methods for setting:
    - All outside borders
    - All inside borders
    - `padding_top`, `padding_right`, `padding_bottom` and `padding_left` on all `TableCell` objects in the `Table`
    - Etc

### 3.2.1 FixedColumnWidthTable

In the next example, you'll be creating a simple `FixedColumnWidthTable` with 3 columns and 2 rows.

```python
#!src/snippet_008.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_008.png)

This is not exactly the best looking table in the world. 
Let's add some padding to all cells to ensure the text doesn't *stick* to the cell borders so much.

```python
#!src/snippet_009.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_009.png)

That's a lot better already. 

As mentioned earlier, the precise ratio of the `page_width` that each column occupies is something you can configure. 
In the next example you'll be setting one column to take up 50% of the `page_width`, 
and divide the remaining space among the other 2.

```python
#!src/snippet_010.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_010.png)

There are some other minor tweaks you can apply. 
To really visualize the next tweak, we should add some more data.

```python
#!src/snippet_011.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_011.png)

### 3.2.2 FlexibleColumnWidthTable

In the next example you're going to create a `FlexibleColumnWidthTable` similar to the ones you created earlier. 
The difference between both kinds of `Table` will become obvious.

```python
#!src/snippet_012.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_012.png)

Let's set the padding. That'll make this `Table` look a bit better.

```python
#!src/snippet_013.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_013.png)

As you can see, this `Table` only takes up as much space as is needed to render the content in each `TableCell`.
This is more in line with the behavior you'd expect from an `HTML` `<table>` element.

### 3.2.3 Setting layout properties on individual cells of a `Table`

In the previous examples you've already set some layout properties. You've set padding and applied alternating background colors. Of course, there are use-cases where you'd like to set these properties on individual cell objects. 

In order to do that, you'll need to construct a `TableCell` object and apply the style there. This may feel like a bit of a workaround, but you've already been using this object without knowing it.

Every time you've added anything to a `Table` that isn't `TableCell` it was automatically getting wrapped in a `TableCell` object.

In the next example, you'll be setting the background color of an individual cell to `X11Color('Red')` and removing two of its borders.

```python
#!src/snippet_014.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_014.png)

This is particularly useful when you're building a comparison matrix, and you'd like to *remove* the `TableCell` at the top-left corner.

In the next example you'll build a feature-comparison matrix for several mobile tourist guides;

```python
#!src/snippet_015.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_015.png)

### 3.2.4 Incomplete `Table`

`Table` requires you to specify the number of rows and columns up front. Sometimes however, the amount of data does not really match `rows x columns`, and the final few cells of your `Table` are not needed.

In order to avoid having to pass empty `TableCell` or `Paragraph` objects, you can rely on the auto-complete feature of the `Table` implementation.

Whenever a `Table` does not have `rows x columns` objects in it, the remaining cells are filled with blank by default. The style (borders, backgrounds, etc) is also copied from the default style.

In the next example you'll create an incomplete `Table` and watch how the `Table` is filled by `borb`.

```python
#!src/snippet_016.py
```

You'll have noticed that you created a `Table` that expects 6 pieces of content. 
Yet, you added only 4. 
The remainder will be dealt with by `borb` automatically.

![enter image description here](img/snippet_016.png)

**Keep in mind the style will be the default style.** 
If that's not what you want, you should add each TableCell individually, 
or write a convenience method that builds empty cells with the appropriate style.

### 3.2.5 Setting `col_span` and `row_span`

Sometimes, you'd like to shake things up a bit. 
For instance using a `TableCell` that spans multiple rows or columns. 
`borb` naturally supports concepts such as `col_span` and `row_span`

In the next example you'll be using `col_span` on a `TableCell` object.

```python
#!src/snippet_017.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_017.png)

Of course, you can do the same for `row_span`:

```python
#!src/snippet_018.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_018.png)

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

## 3.3 Nesting `Table` in `List` and vice-versa

### 3.3.1 Nesting a `Table` in a `List`

You can add a `Table` to a `List`, since `List` accepts any `LayoutElement` as content,
and `Table` implements the `LayoutElement` interface.

```python
#!src/snippet_019.py
```

![enter image description here](img/snippet_019.png)

### 3.3.2 Nesting a `List` in a `Table`

Conversely, you can also use `List` inside a `Table`.

```python
#!src/snippet_020.py
```
