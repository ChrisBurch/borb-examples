# 5 Working with existing PDFs

For some use-cases, you won't be creating the PDF's yourself. Imagine setting up a pipeline that automatically processes PDF invoices. Or even processing order forms.

Most of these workflows can be boiled down to some simple steps that can be handled with `borb`.

In this section you'll learn the ins and outs of working with existing PDF's.

## 5.1 Extracting meta-information

Suppose you have a PDF document. Did you know it contains meta-information? Try it. Next time you have a PDF open in Adobe, press CTRL+D to open the document properties. You'll find things like:

- Author
- Producer
- Creation date
- Modification date
- Software that created the document
- Etc

It can be very useful to be able to extract these. Processing an invoice for instance might be more accurate if we know "supplier A uses software B to create their invoices, and python script C works best for that" versus "supplier X uses software Y, which is best handled by script Z".

### 5.1.1 Extracting the author from a PDF

In the next example you'll start by extracting the author from the PDF. 
This is of course assuming this property was set by whatever software created the PDF.

In order to be able to test these examples and get the same result as the book, I am providing a snippet of code here that will generate a very simple PDF;

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_001.py
from borb.io.read.types import Name, String, Dictionary
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():
    # create Document
    doc: Document = Document()

    # create Page
    page: Page = Page()

    # add Page to Document
    doc.add_page(page)

    # set a PageLayout
    layout: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(page)

    # add a Paragraph
    layout.add(
        Paragraph(
            """
                        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. 
                        Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. 
                        Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 
                        Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
                         """
        )
    )

    # set the /Info dictionary
    doc["XRef"]["Trailer"][Name("Info")] = Dictionary()

    # set the /Author
    doc["XRef"]["Trailer"]["Info"][Name("Author")] = String("Joris Schellekens")

    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as out_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(out_file_handle, doc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The PDF doesn't really look all that special when you open it.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_001_001.png)

But, when you open the properties (the exact shortcut differs depending on which PDF viewer you're using of course), you'll see the meta-data:

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_001_002.png)

Now, let's assume you're getting this PDF (perhaps via email, or some automated process) and you'd like to extract the author from it.

`borb` allows you to do that in just a few lines of code:

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_002.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    # read the Document
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle)

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # print the \Author key from the \Info dictionary
    print("Author: %s" % doc.get_document_info().get_author())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This will print `Joris Schellekens` to the terminal (in the case of the demo-PDF created by the earlier example of course).

Keep in mind that this property (`/Author`) is not mandatory. 
So the code may simply return (and thus print) `None`. 
This is not a bug, it simply means the `/Author` property was not explicitly set.

### 5.1.2 Extracting the producer from a PDF

Similarly, you can extract other properties, like the producer. This is typically the name of the piece of software that created the PDF (or last modified the PDF).

This is important. The PDF specification is not always precise or clear-cut. 
Some PDF software might do things a little differently than others, thus causing potential incompatibility.

You can easily mitigate this by checking the producer property, and separating the problematic files.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_003.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    # read the Document
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle)

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # print the \Producer key from the \Info dictionary
    print("Producer: %s" % doc.get_document_info().get_producer())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Of course, now that you know how to extract the author and the producer, 
you can check out the other methods of `DocumentInfo` and find out even more about any PDF that comes your way.

### 5.1.3 using XMP meta information

This is from `adobe.com`:

> Adobeâ€™s Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) is a file labeling technology that lets you embed metadata into files themselves during the content creation process. 
> With an XMP enabled application, your workgroup can capture meaningful information about a project (such as titles and descriptions, searchable keywords, and up-to-date author and copyright information) in a format that is easily understood by your team as well as by software applications, hardware devices, and even file formats. 
> Best of all, as team members modify files and assets, they can edit and update the metadata in real time during the workflow.>

This next example is similar to the earlier example involving `DocumentInfo`.
But in stead, we will use `XMPDocumentInfo`. This class offers even more methods to get information from a PDF `Document`.

Keep in mind that XMP is not a requirement for a PDF `Document` to be valid. 
So you may find these methods return `None` when you test them on a `Document` that does not have embedded XMP data.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_004.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    # read the Document
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle)

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # print the ID using XMP meta info
    print("ID: %s" % doc.get_xmp_document_info().get_document_id())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

For the document I tested, this printed:

```commandline
xmp.id:54e5adca-494c-4c10-983a-daa03cdae65a
```

## 5.2 Extracting text from a PDF

Being able to extract text from a PDF is a fundamental skill. 
In the deep-dive, you'll learn more about PDF syntax, and why text-extraction is a non-trivial thing.

For now, you can start with an easy example where all visible text on the page is extracted.

This extraction process does not take into account any structure that may be present on the page itself. 
Hence the name `SimpleTextExtraction`.

You'll be using the same input PDF as earlier (containing a paragraph of lorem ipsum).

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_005.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.text.simple_text_extraction import SimpleTextExtraction


def main():

    # read the Document
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    l: SimpleTextExtraction = SimpleTextExtraction()
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l])

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # print the text on the first Page
    print(l.get_text_for_page(0))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here you've used the alternative method for `PDF.loads` which takes an array of `EventListener` objects as its argument.

`PDF.loads` will open the PDF, and start processing PDF syntax. 
Whenever it handles certain commands (rendering text, rendering images, switching to a new page, etc), 
it will send out `Event` objects. These can be handled by the appropriate `EventListener` implementation.

`SimpleTextExtraction` is one of those `EventListener` implementations that listens to:

- The start of a `Page`
- The end of a `Page`
- Begin rendering text mode
- Stop rendering text mode
- Render text command(s)

The code above should print out:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation
ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint
occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est
laborum.
```

{pagebreak}

## 5.3 Extracting text using regular expressions

This is a much more advanced way to extract text from a PDF. 
By using regular expressions, you can easily look for things like "total amount due" followed by some numbers. 
And, in doing so, effectively retrieve the useful data from an invoice.

In the next example you'll be doing exactly that. 
The code is very similar to what you've done earlier.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_006.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.text.regular_expression_text_extraction import (
    RegularExpressionTextExtraction,
)


def main():

    # read the Document
    # fmt: off
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    l: RegularExpressionTextExtraction = RegularExpressionTextExtraction("[lL]orem .* [dD]olor")
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l])
    # fmt: on

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # print matching groups
    for i, m in enumerate(l.get_matches_for_page(0)):
        print("%d %s" % (i, m.group(0)))
        for r in m.get_bounding_boxes():
            print(
                "\t%f %f %f %f" % (r.get_x(), r.get_y(), r.get_width(), r.get_height())
            )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Like before, you constructed an implementation of `EventListener` and passed it to the `PDF.loads` method. 
`RegularExpressionTextExtraction` takes a regular expression as its single argument.

Once the `Document` has been parsed, you can retrieve all matches by specifying a `page_nr`. 
Pages are numbered from 0.

You'll get back a `typing.List[PDFMatch]` which is meant to behave like a `re.Match` object. 
Most of its fields and methods are written to work interchangeably with `re.Match`.

Of course, because a PDF has a dimensionality to it (content is located on an x/y plane), 
there are some extra methods. Such as `get_bounding_boxes()` which returns a `typing.List[Rectangle]'.

You may be wondering why a single match against a regular expression would return multiple bounding boxes. 
This happens when content is matched over multiple lines.

In this example however, the output should be:

```
0 Lorem ipsum dolor
	59.500000 740.916000 99.360000 11.100000
```

indicating a single match, with text "lorem ipsum dolor", 
with bounding box (lower left corner) at `[59.5, 740.916]` and a width of `99.36` and a height of `11.1`.

{pagebreak}

## 5.4 Extracting text using its bounding box

Another extraction process relies on the rendering of the PDF itself. 
Perhaps the PDF's you are processing always have some kind of information at a precise location 
(e.g. an invoice number in the top right corner).

This implementation of `EventListener` allows you to filter events (i.e. rendering instructions) by providing `borb` with a bounding box.

In the next example you'll be using the coordinates from the previous example, to build a filter for `SimpleTextExtraction`.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_007.py
import typing
from decimal import Decimal

from borb.pdf.canvas.geometry.rectangle import Rectangle
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.location.location_filter import LocationFilter
from borb.toolkit.text.simple_text_extraction import SimpleTextExtraction


def main():

    # define the Rectangle of interest
    r: Rectangle = Rectangle(Decimal(59), Decimal(740), Decimal(99), Decimal(11))

    # define SimpleTextExtraction
    l0: SimpleTextExtraction = SimpleTextExtraction()

    # apply a LocationFilter on top of SimpleTextExtraction
    l1: LocationFilter = LocationFilter(r)
    l1.add_listener(l0)

    # read the Document
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l1])

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # print the text inside the Rectangle of interest
    print(l0.get_text_for_page(0))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This prints:

```commandline
Lorem ipsum dolor
```

{pagebreak}

## 5.5 Combining regular expressions and bounding boxes

Of course, `borb` is designed to be a library, 
so the idea of being able to strap together your own tools using the toolkit is very important to me.

In the next example you'll be combining a regular expression expression extraction technique with a bounding box.

First you'll be looking for the precise location of the text "nisi ut aliquip". 
Once you have matched this regular expression, you also have its location on the page.

Then you can extend this box, 
knowing the text you'd really like to extract will be on the right of that piece of text.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_008.py
import typing
from decimal import Decimal

from borb.pdf.canvas.geometry.rectangle import Rectangle
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.location.location_filter import LocationFilter
from borb.toolkit.text.regular_expression_text_extraction import (
    RegularExpressionTextExtraction,
    PDFMatch,
)
from borb.toolkit.text.simple_text_extraction import SimpleTextExtraction


def main():

    # set up RegularExpressionTextExtraction
    # fmt: off
    l0: RegularExpressionTextExtraction = RegularExpressionTextExtraction("[nN]isi .* aliquip")
    # fmt: on

    # process Document
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l0])
    assert doc is not None

    # find match
    m: typing.Optional[PDFMatch] = next(iter(l0.get_matches_for_page(0)), None)
    assert m is not None

    # get page width
    w: Decimal = doc.get_page(0).get_page_info().get_width()

    # change rectangle to get more text
    r0: Rectangle = m.get_bounding_boxes()[0]
    r1: Rectangle = Rectangle(
        r0.get_x() + r0.get_width(), r0.get_y(), w - r0.get_x(), r0.get_height()
    )

    # process document (again) filtering by rectangle
    l1: LocationFilter = LocationFilter(r1)
    l2: SimpleTextExtraction = SimpleTextExtraction()
    l1.add_listener(l2)
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l1])
    assert doc is not None

    # get text
    print(l2.get_text_for_page(0))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example is a lot to take in. 
Try it out, read through it carefully. 
It's important to understand these basic concepts in `borb` to really get the most out of it.

This example starts out similar to the earlier example ["Extracting text using regular expressions"](#33-extracting-text-using-regular-expressions), 
it uses the returned `PDFMatch` to determine the location of the text. 
With this location it processes the `Document` again, filtering a modified bounding box.

This example prints:

```commandline
ex ea commodo conse uat. Duis aute irure dolor in
```

This example might seem contrived, but there are definitely use-cases where this exact behavior comes in handy. 
Imagine processing a `Document`, looking for "amount due", 
and then modifying the bounding box to retrieve the amount and currency that is typically next to it.

The same strategy can be used to extract addresses from invoices, or anything similar really.

## 5.6 Extracting keywords from a PDF

### 5.6.1 Extracting keywords from a PDF using TF-IDF

From wikipedia:

> In information retrieval, tfâ€“idf, TF*IDF, or TFIDF, short for term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. 
> It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling. 
> The tfâ€“idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. 
> tfâ€“idf is one of the most popular term-weighting schemes today.

#### 5.6.1.1 Term Frequency

From wikipedia:

> Suppose we have a set of English text documents and wish to rank them by which document is more relevant to the query, "the brown cow". 
> A simple way to start out is by eliminating documents that do not contain all three words "the", "brown", and "cow", but this still leaves many documents. 
> To further distinguish them, we might count the number of times each term occurs in each document; the number of times a term occurs in a document is called its term frequency. 
> However, in the case where the length of documents varies greatly, adjustments are often made (see definition below). 

#### 5.6.1.2 Inverse document frequency

From wikipedia:

> Because the term "the" is so common, term frequency will tend to incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word "the" more frequently, without giving enough weight to the more meaningful terms "brown" and "cow". 
> The term "the" is not a good keyword to distinguish relevant and non-relevant documents and terms, unlike the less-common words "brown" and "cow". Hence, an inverse document frequency factor is incorporated which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely.

#### 5.6.1.3 Using TF-IDF in `borb`

Let's start by creating a `Document` with a few `Paragraph` objects in it.
Since you'll be eliminating stop words (which are language-dependent), this `Document` needs to contain sensible English text.
You'll be creating a `Document` containing information about "Lorem Ipsum".

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_009.py
from borb.io.read.types import Name, String, Dictionary
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():
    # create Document
    doc: Document = Document()

    # create Page
    page: Page = Page()

    # add Page to Document
    doc.add_page(page)

    # set a PageLayout
    layout: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(page)

    # add first Paragraph
    layout.add(Paragraph("What is Lorem Ipsum?", font="Helvetica-bold"))
    layout.add(
        Paragraph(
            """
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
    """
        )
    )

    # add second Paragraph
    layout.add(Paragraph("Where does it come from?", font="Helvetica-bold"))
    layout.add(
        Paragraph(
            """
    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
    Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
    discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
    This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
    The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
    """
        )
    )

    # store
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as out_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(out_file_handle, doc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This should produce a `Document` like this:

Now you can unleash `TFIDFKeywordExtraction` on the `Document` you made;

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_010.py
import typing

from borb.io.read.types import Name, String, Dictionary
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.text.tf_idf_keyword_extraction import TFIDFKeywordExtraction
from borb.toolkit.text.stop_words import ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS


def main():

    l: TFIDFKeywordExtraction = TFIDFKeywordExtraction(stopwords=ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS)

    # load
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l])

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    print(l.get_keywords_for_page(0))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This outputs:

```commandline

```

### 5.6.2 Extracting keywords from a PDF using  textrank

TextRank is a graph-based ranking model for text processing which can be used in order to find the most relevant sentences in text and also to find keywords. 
The algorithm is explained in detail in the paper at https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_011.py
import typing

from borb.io.read.types import Name, String, Dictionary
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.text.text_rank_keyword_extraction import TextRankKeywordExtraction
from borb.toolkit.text.stop_words import ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS

# nltk
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')


def main():

    l: TextRankKeywordExtraction = TextRankKeywordExtraction()

    # load
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l])

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    print(l.get_keywords_for_page(0))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This outputs:

```commandline
/usr/bin/python3.8 /home/joris/Code/borb-examples-dev/chapter_005/src/snippet_011.py

## 5.7 Extracting color-information

This is perhaps a bit more of a tangent, but I can imagine it may be useful. 
In this particular example you'll be extracting color-information from a PDF.

Given the previous examples, you can easily adapt this technique to build a filter (similar to the location-based filter). 

By doing so, you unlock the possibility of processing a PDF by saying "look for text in the color red" or "look for text in the top right corner, in blue".

In this example, you'll be using `ColorSpectrumExtraction` to retrieve all the colors on the `Page`. This is a stepping stone to building bigger and better things. Although in and of itself this can already be useful to determine color-blindness compatibility of a given `Document`.

In the deep-dive, you'll learn the ins and outs of implementing your own `EventListener`.

To start this example, you'll be creating a PDF containing multiple colors. You'll be adding 3 `Paragraph` objects (red, green, blue) and one `Image`.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_012.py
from borb.io.read.types import Name, String, Dictionary
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import HexColor
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.image.image import Image

from decimal import Decimal


def main():
    # create Document
    doc: Document = Document()

    # create Page
    page: Page = Page()

    # add Page to Document
    doc.add_page(page)

    # set a PageLayout
    layout: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(page)

    # the following code adds 3 paragraphs, each in a different color
    layout.add(Paragraph("Hello World!", font_color=HexColor("FF0000")))
    layout.add(Paragraph("Hello World!", font_color=HexColor("00FF00")))
    layout.add(Paragraph("Hello World!", font_color=HexColor("0000FF")))

    # the following code adds 1 image
    layout.add(
        Image(
            "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589606663923-283bbd309229?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8",
            width=Decimal(256),
            height=Decimal(256),
        )
    )
    
    # store
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as out_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(out_file_handle, doc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This `Document` will serve as the input for the extraction example. 

Rather than printing the result of the extraction to the command-line, 
you'll create an output-pdf. I think it's a lot more visual to actually see the colors that were extracted, 
rather than having their RGB values printed out on the console.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_013.py
from decimal import Decimal

import typing
from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import HexColor, RGBColor
from borb.pdf.canvas.geometry.rectangle import Rectangle
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.image.image import Image
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.shape.shape import Shape
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.layout_element import Alignment
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.table.flexible_column_width_table import (
    FlexibleColumnWidthTable,
)
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.canvas.line_art.line_art_factory import LineArtFactory
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.color.color_spectrum_extraction import ColorSpectrumExtraction


def main():

    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    l: ColorSpectrumExtraction = ColorSpectrumExtraction()
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(pdf_file_handle, [l])

    # extract colors
    colors: typing.List[typing.Tuple[RGBColor, Decimal]] = l.get_colors_for_page(0)
    colors = colors[0:32]

    # create output Document
    doc_out: Document = Document()

    # add Page
    p: Page = Page()
    doc_out.add_page(p)

    # add PageLayout
    l: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(p)

    # add Paragraph
    l.add(Paragraph("These are the colors used in the input PDF:"))

    # add Table
    t: FlexibleColumnWidthTable = FlexibleColumnWidthTable(
        number_of_rows=8, number_of_columns=4, horizontal_alignment=Alignment.CENTERED
    )
    for c in colors:
        t.add(
            Shape(
                LineArtFactory.droplet(
                    Rectangle(Decimal(0), Decimal(0), Decimal(32), Decimal(32))
                ),
                stroke_color=c[0],
                fill_color=c[0],
            )
        )
    t.set_padding_on_all_cells(Decimal(5), Decimal(5), Decimal(5), Decimal(5))
    l.add(t)

    # store
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as pdf_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_file_handle, doc_out)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 5.8 Extracting font-information

In this example you'll be extracting font-names from an existing PDF.
This may be useful (in later examples) to handle situations in which you know a certain snippet of information is always written in a particular font.

You'll start by creating a PDF with several fonts;

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_014.py
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.list.unordered_list import UnorderedList
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():
    # create Document
    doc: Document = Document()

    # create Page
    page: Page = Page()

    # add Page to Document
    doc.add_page(page)

    # set a PageLayout
    layout: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(page)

    # add UnorderedList containing a (twice nested) UnorderedList
    for font_name in ["Helvetica", "Helvetica-Bold", "Courier"]:
        layout.add(Paragraph("Hello World from %s!" % font_name, font=font_name))

    # store
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as out_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(out_file_handle, doc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_014.png)

And now you can process that PDF and retrieve the fonts;

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_015.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.text.font_extraction import FontExtraction


def main():

    # read the Document
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    l: FontExtraction = FontExtraction()
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l])

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # print the names of the Fonts
    print(l.get_font_names_for_page(0))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This prints:

```commandline
['Helvetica', 'Helvetica-Bold', 'Courier']
```

You can of course go looking at the code for `FontExtraction` (I highly encourage you to do so).
This should enable you to write your own filter (similar to `LocationFilter`) to filter on fonts.

### 5.8.1 Filtering by `font`

In this example you'll be using `FontNameFilter` to retrieve all text on a `Page` that was written in `Courier`.
First things first though, let's create an example PDF with text in different fonts;

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_016.py
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.list.unordered_list import UnorderedList
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():
    # create Document
    doc: Document = Document()

    # create Page
    page: Page = Page()

    # add Page to Document
    doc.add_page(page)

    # set a PageLayout
    layout: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(page)

    # add UnorderedList containing a (twice nested) UnorderedList
    for font_name in ["Helvetica", "Helvetica-Bold", "Courier"]:
        layout.add(Paragraph("Hello World from %s!" % font_name, font=font_name))

    # store
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as out_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(out_file_handle, doc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This generates the following PDF:

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_016.png)

Now we can run the code to filter on `font_name`:

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_017.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.text.font_name_filter import FontNameFilter
from borb.toolkit.text.simple_text_extraction import SimpleTextExtraction


def main():

    # create FontNameFilter
    l0: FontNameFilter = FontNameFilter("Courier")

    # filtered text just gets passed to SimpleTextExtraction
    l1: SimpleTextExtraction = SimpleTextExtraction()
    l0.add_listener(l1)

    # read the Document
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l0])

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # print the names of the Fonts
    print(l1.get_text_for_page(0))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This should print:

```commandline
Hello World, from Courier!
```

### 5.8.2 Filtering by `font_color`

Being able to filter by `font_color` allows you to extract text in a much more fine-grained way.
You could filter out only the red text from an invoice, 
or combine this particular filter with other filter implementations and do even crazier things.

This implementation of `EventListener` takes 2 arguments at construction:

- `color` : The `Color` you'd like to keep
- `maximum_normalized_rgb_distance` :   This is the maximum allowable distance between the `Color` in the PDF and the `color` parameter. This allows you to filter on "everything that looks kinda red" rather than "everything that is this exact shade of red".                                  
                                        The distance is defined as ((r0 - r1)Â² - (g0 - g1)Â² + (b0 - b1)Â²) / 3, with r, g, b being the red, green, blue components of the `Color`.

We're going to start by creating an input PDF with text in various colors.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_018.py
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.list.unordered_list import UnorderedList
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import X11Color


def main():
    # create Document
    doc: Document = Document()

    # create Page
    page: Page = Page()

    # add Page to Document
    doc.add_page(page)

    # set a PageLayout
    layout: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(page)

    # add UnorderedList containing a (twice nested) UnorderedList
    for color_name in ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]:
        layout.add(
            Paragraph(
                "Hello World from %s!" % color_name, font_color=X11Color(color_name)
            )
        )

    # store
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as out_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(out_file_handle, doc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This generates the following PDF:

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_018.png)

Now we can filter the text in the PDF by selecting the red letters:

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_019.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.text.font_color_filter import FontColorFilter
from borb.toolkit.text.simple_text_extraction import SimpleTextExtraction
from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import X11Color

from decimal import Decimal


def main():

    # create FontColorFilter
    l0: FontColorFilter = FontColorFilter(X11Color("Red"), Decimal(0.01))

    # filtered text just gets passed to SimpleTextExtraction
    l1: SimpleTextExtraction = SimpleTextExtraction()
    l0.add_listener(l1)

    # read the Document
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l0])

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # print the names of the Fonts
    print(l1.get_text_for_page(0))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This should print:

```commandline
Hello World, in Red!
```

{pagebreak}

## 5.9 Extracting images from a PDF

In this example you'll be extracting images from an existing PDF.
Keep in mind the images may be subject to copyright, they may not have been intended for you to be able to extract them.

To get started, let's briefly re-iterate one of the earlier examples about inserting an `Image` object in a PDF.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_020.py
from borb.io.read.types import Name, String, Dictionary
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.image.image import Image

from decimal import Decimal


def main():
    # create Document
    doc: Document = Document()

    # create Page
    page: Page = Page()

    # add Page to Document
    doc.add_page(page)

    # set a PageLayout
    layout: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(page)

    # define 3 Image URLs
    image_urls: typing.List[str] = [
        "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589606663923-283bbd309229?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8",
        "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496637721836-f46d116e6d34?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8",
        "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611873101970-dfa544c23494?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8",
    ]

    # add an Image for each URL
    for image_url in image_urls:
        layout.add(Image(image_url, width=Decimal(128), height=Decimal(128)))

    # store
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as out_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(out_file_handle, doc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_020.png)

Now that you have an input `Document`, let's go ahead and extract the `Image` from it.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_021.py
import typing

from borb.io.read.types import Name, String, Dictionary
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.toolkit.text.text_rank_keyword_extraction import TextRankKeywordExtraction
from borb.toolkit.text.stop_words import ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS
from borb.toolkit.image.simple_image_extraction import SimpleImageExtraction


def main():

    l: SimpleImageExtraction = SimpleImageExtraction()

    # load
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle, [l])

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    print(l.get_images_for_page(0))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This should print:

```
<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=2000x3000 at 0x7F3BE45E5C40>
<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=4000x6000 at 0x7F3BE43FB760>
<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=2640x3300 at 0x7F3BE441B580>
```

What's interesting is that even though you inserted the `Image` objects and specified a particular size, the extracted `Image` is actually a lot larger. 
This is because PDF simply has its own way of dealing with resizing images. 
And there are use-cases where you might actually want this behavior. 

You could embed a tiny example of an `Image` in a `Document`, 
knowing the recipient can extract the full (much richer) `Image`.

Of course, if you're using this `Image` as a company logo, 
or part of the header/footer of the `Document`, 
you typically want the image to be as small as possible (while remaining legible).

In one of the upcoming examples you'll see how to subsample an `Image` in a PDF, 
and you'll see firsthand how this technique can help reduce your document's memory footprint.

### 5.9.1 Modifying images in an existing PDF

In this example you'll be modifying the images in a PDF.
You'll be using the PDF you created earlier (with 3 pineapple images) as a starting point.

First you'll be exploring the PDF, using the JSON-like structure `borb` has created.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_022.py
import typing

from borb.io.read.types import Name, String, Dictionary
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    # load
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle)

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # print debug information for each Image (which PDF calls XObjects)
    for k, v in doc.get_page(0)["Resources"]["XObject"].items():
        print("%s\t%s" % (k, str(v)))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code prints:

```
Im1	<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=2000x3000 at 0x7F74380D0490>
Im2	<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=4000x6000 at 0x7F7437F1B970>
Im3	<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=2640x3300 at 0x7F74367D56D0>
```

This example shows us that the PDF has stored the `Image` objects in the `Page` under `Resources\XObject\Im1` (and `Im2`, `Im3` respectively).

You can now modify these and store the `Document`.

First, you'll write this simple function to convert an `Image` to its sepia counterpart.
"sepia" is just a fancy way of saying "old timey brown pictures".

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_023.py
import typing

from borb.io.read.types import Name, String, Dictionary
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

from PIL import Image as PILImage


def modify_image(image: PILImage.Image):
    w = image.width
    h = image.height
    pixels = image.load()
    for i in range(0, w):
        for j in range(0, h):
            r, g, b = pixels[i, j]

            # convert to sepia
            new_r = r * 0.393 + g * 0.769 + b * 0.189
            new_g = r * 0.349 + g * 0.686 + b * 0.168
            new_b = r * 0.272 + g * 0.534 + b * 0.131

            # set
            pixels[i, j] = (int(new_r), int(new_g), int(new_b))


def main():

    # load
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as in_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(in_file_handle)

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # modify each Image
    for k, v in doc.get_page(0)["Resources"]["XObject"].items():
        print("%s\t%s" % (k, str(v)))
        modify_image(v)

    # store PDF
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as out_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(out_file_handle, doc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The result should look like this:

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_023.png)

### 5.9.2 Subsampling images in an existing PDF

As you've found out in a previous example, sometimes the dimensions at which an `Image` is displayed are not the same as the dimensions at which it was stored.
This can lead to a rather bulky PDF, if each `Image` is substantially larger than its display-dimensions.

In the next example, you'll be fixing that. 
Luckily `borb` comes with `ImageFormatOptimization` which does all the heavy lifting for you.

As a benchmark, you can first have a look at the file-characteristics of the original input PDF.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_024_001.png)

You can see the file is roughly 5Mb large.
Now you can use the following code to optimize the `Image` dimensions:

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_024.py
import typing

When you check out the file-stats on the output-file, the difference is astonishing:

You'll see that the output file looks the same, although there may have been some quality loss in the images.

## 5.10 Working with embedded files

PDF is more than just a digital paper-replacement. 
PDF also has some features that go beyond "imitating paper".
For instance PDF allows you embed one or multiple files inside the document. 
By doing so, you can provide extra resources for whoever reads the document.

In one particular use-case, a german invoicing standard (ZUGFeRD) requires the creator of the invoice to embed an XML representation of the invoice, 
to ensure the document can be processed automatically.

In this section you'll handle both extraction of embedded files, and appending embedded files to a `Document`.

### 5.10.1 Embedding files in a PDF

In this example, you'll be creating a `Document` containing one `Paragraph`, and embed a json-file.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_025.py
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    # create empty Document
    d: Document = Document()

    # add Page
    p: Page = Page()
    d.add_page(p)

    # create PageLayout
    l: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(p)

    # add Paragraph
    l.add(
        Paragraph(
            """
                    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. 
                    Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. 
                    Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 
                    Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.    
                    """
        )
    )

    # create bytes for embedded file
    file_bytes = b"""
    {
        "lorem": "ipsum",
        "dolor": "sit"
    }
    """

    # add embedded file
    d.add_embedded_file("lorem_ipsum.json", file_bytes)

    # store
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as pdf_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_file_handle, d)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The PDF should look something like this: 

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_025_001.png)

Notice the warning you see atop the PDF viewer. 
This may of course vary depending on the viewer you're using.
If you open the embedded file pane (again depending on your editor) you may see something similar to this:

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_025_002.png)

### 5.10.2 Extracting embedded files from a PDF

Now that you can embed files in a PDF, let's see how you can retrieve those files again.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_026.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    # read the Document
    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(pdf_file_handle)

    # check whether we have read a Document
    assert doc is not None

    # retrieve all embedded files and their bytes
    for k, v in doc.get_embedded_files().items():

        # display the file name, and the size
        print("%s, %d bytes" % (k, len(v)))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This should print:

```
lorem_ipsum.json, 66 bytes
```

Of course, rather than just displaying the byte-count you could also write the bytes to a file again.
Or process them directly using the `io` API in Python.

{pagebreak}

## 5.11 Merging PDF documents

This is one of the most common usecases in working with PDF.
In the next example you'll be merging multiple existing PDF documents.

You'll start by creating two methods that each create (and write) a PDF document.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_027.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

import typing

from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import HexColor
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    d: Document = Document()
    p: Page = Page()
    d.add_page(p)

    l: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(p)
    l.add(
        Paragraph(
            """
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                    """,
            font_color=HexColor("de6449"),
        )
    )

    with open("output_001.pdf", "wb") as pdf_out_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_out_handle, d)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_027.png)

That should take care of the first PDF.
Now you can write a second (similar) PDF document:

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_028.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

import typing

from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import HexColor
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    d: Document = Document()
    p: Page = Page()
    d.add_page(p)

    l: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(p)
    l.add(
        Paragraph(
            """
                    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. 
                    Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. 
                    Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 
                    Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
                    """,
            font_color=HexColor("f1cd2e"),
        )
    )

    with open("output_002.pdf", "wb") as pdf_out_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_out_handle, d)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_028.png)

Finally, you can write the main method, which will create both documents, read them, and merge them.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_029.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

import typing

from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import HexColor
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    # open doc_001
    doc_001: typing.Optional[Document] = Document()
    with open("output_001.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file_handle:
        doc_001 = PDF.loads(pdf_file_handle)

    # open doc_002
    doc_002: typing.Optional[Document] = Document()
    with open("output_002.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file_handle:
        doc_002 = PDF.loads(pdf_file_handle)

    # merge
    doc_001.add_document(doc_002)

    # write
    with open("output_003.pdf", "wb") as pdf_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_file_handle, doc_001)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_029.png)

You don't have to fully merge both `Document` objects, you can just copy a couple of `Page` objects from one `Document` to another.     
In the next example you'll be selecting one `Page` from each `Document` and building a new PDF with them.

You'll start by creating a slightly modified version of the first document from the previous example.
This document has 10 pages.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_030.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

from decimal import Decimal
import typing

from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import HexColor
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    d: Document = Document()

    N: int = 10
    for i in range(0, N):
        p: Page = Page()
        d.add_page(p)
        l: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(p)
        l.add(
            Paragraph(
                "Page %d of %d" % (i + 1, N),
                font_color=HexColor("0b3954"),
                font_size=Decimal(24),
            )
        )
        l.add(
            Paragraph(
                """
                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                        """,
                font_color=HexColor("de6449"),
            )
        )

    with open("output_001.pdf", "wb") as pdf_out_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_out_handle, d)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The page number is printed atop each page, to make it easier to identify them later.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_030.png)

The second document will also have 10 pages. The page number will also be displayed atop each page:

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_031.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

import typing
from decimal import Decimal

from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    # open doc_001
    doc_001: typing.Optional[Document] = Document()
    with open("output_001.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file_handle:
        doc_001 = PDF.loads(pdf_file_handle)

    # open doc_002
    doc_002: typing.Optional[Document] = Document()
    with open("output_002.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file_handle:
        doc_002 = PDF.loads(pdf_file_handle)

    # create new document
    d: Document = Document()
    for i in range(0, 10):
        p: typing.Optional[Page] = None
        if i % 2 == 0:
            p = doc_001.get_page(i)
        else:
            p = doc_002.get_page(i)
        d.add_page(p)

    # write
    with open("output_003.pdf", "wb") as pdf_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_file_handle, d)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_031.png)

To build the merged document you'll be selecting a page from each input document in turn, until the merged document has 10 pages.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_032.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

import typing
from decimal import Decimal

from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF


def main():

    # open doc_001
    doc_001: typing.Optional[Document] = Document()
    with open("output_001.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file_handle:
        doc_001 = PDF.loads(pdf_file_handle)

    # open doc_002
    doc_002: typing.Optional[Document] = Document()
    with open("output_002.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file_handle:
        doc_002 = PDF.loads(pdf_file_handle)

    # create new document
    d: Document = Document()
    for i in range(0, 10):
        p: typing.Optional[Page] = None
        if i % 2 == 0:
            p = doc_001.get_page(i)
        else:
            p = doc_002.get_page(i)
        d.add_page(p)

    # write
    with open("output_003.pdf", "wb") as pdf_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_file_handle, d)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The final document alternates pages between both input documents (which is obvious from the color and page numbers).

## 5.12 Removing pages from  PDF documents

Sometimes you may want to remove a `Page` from a PDF.
e.g. removing a cover-page before text-extraction may speed things up (one less page to process)

In the next example you'll be removing the first `Page` from a `Document`.
First of course, we need to create a `Document` to start with;

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_033.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

import typing
from decimal import Decimal

from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import MultiColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import HexColor


def main():

    # create new document
    d: Document = Document()

    # add Page
    p: Page = Page()
    d.add_page(p)
    page_number: int = 1

    # create PageLayout
    l: PageLayout = MultiColumnLayout(p)

    # adding Pages
    for _ in range(0, 20):
        if l.get_page() != p or page_number == 1:
            l.add(
                Paragraph(
                    "Page %d" % page_number,
                    font_color=HexColor("f1cd2e"),
                    font_size=Decimal(20),
                    font="Courier-Bold",
                )
            )
            p = l.get_page()
            page_number += 1

        l.add(
            Paragraph(
                """
                        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. 
                        Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. 
                        Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 
                        Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
                        """
            )
        )

    # write
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as pdf_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_file_handle, d)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_033.png)

Now that we have a substantial `Document`, we can remove a `Page` from it;

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_034.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

import typing
from decimal import Decimal

from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import MultiColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import HexColor


def main():

    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(pdf_file_handle)

    assert doc is not None

    # remove Page
    doc.pop_page(1)

    # store Document
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as pdf_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_file_handle, doc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples/master/chapter_005/img/snippet_034.png)

You can see (in the thumbnail panel on the left side) that the second page was removed.

{pagebreak}

## 5.13 Rotating pages in PDF documents

In this example you'll be rotating a `Page` 90 degrees clockwise. 
You can rotate a `Page` any multiple of 90 degrees.

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_035.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

import typing
from decimal import Decimal

from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import MultiColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import HexColor


def main():

    # create new document
    d: Document = Document()

    # add Page
    p: Page = Page()
    d.add_page(p)
    page_number: int = 1

    # create PageLayout
    l: PageLayout = MultiColumnLayout(p)

    # adding Pages
    for _ in range(0, 20):
        if l.get_page() != p or page_number == 1:
            l.add(
                Paragraph(
                    "Page %d" % page_number,
                    font_color=HexColor("f1cd2e"),
                    font_size=Decimal(20),
                    font="Courier-Bold",
                )
            )
            p = l.get_page()
            page_number += 1

        l.add(

You already know this PDF, it's the same from the previous examples.

Now let's rotate a `Page`:

```python
#!chapter_005/src/snippet_036.py
import typing
from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF

import typing
from decimal import Decimal

from borb.pdf.document.document import Document
from borb.pdf.page.page import Page
from borb.pdf.pdf import PDF
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import MultiColumnLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.page_layout import PageLayout
from borb.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from borb.pdf.canvas.color.color import HexColor


def main():

    doc: typing.Optional[Document] = None
    with open("output.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file_handle:
        doc = PDF.loads(pdf_file_handle)

    assert doc is not None

    # rotate Page
    doc.get_page(0).rotate_right()

    # store Document
    with open("output.pdf", "wb") as pdf_file_handle:
        PDF.dumps(pdf_file_handle, doc)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 5.14 Conclusion

In this section you've learned the basics of working with existing PDF documents. 
You've seen how to extract text, regular expressions, images, font-information and color-information.

And you've seen the basics of merging PDF's and removing one or more pages from a PDF.

This section, together with the previous wraps up the basics of what you can do with `borb`.

I would encourage you to continue reading, and more importantly to continue exploring `borb`.
There are many more options and algorithms that you may find useful. 
As a developer, expanding your toolkit with more knowledge is never a bad thing.
